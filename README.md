# eCommerce-Data-Analysis
This project is a Python-based eCommerce Store simulation built inside a Jupyter Notebook.
It allows users to browse products, add/remove items from a cart, place orders, and calculate the final bill.
The project also demonstrates inventory management and can be extended into a full application.


 #Features
 Display available products
 Add items to cart
 Remove items from cart
 View cart details (items + total price)
 Checkout & billing system
 Inventory/stock management


# Dataset / Data Handling
Products stored in Python data structures (lists/dictionaries)
Prices, stock, and categories managed dynamically
Option to extend with external datasets (CSV/Excel/Database)


# Project Workflow
Start the notebook → Load the eCommerce_Store.ipynb file in Jupyter.
Run the cells → Initialize product catalog & shopping cart.
Interact → Choose products, add/remove from cart.
Checkout → View final bill with total amount.
Manage Inventory → Stock is updated as items are purchased.


 # Tools & Technologies Used
Python 3 (core language)
Jupyter Notebook (development environment)
Pandas / Numpy (if used for data handling)
Matplotlib / Seaborn (if visualizations are included)

#Use Cases
 Basic simulation of an online shopping system
 Educational project to understand Python data handling & OOP concepts
 Foundation for building a real eCommerce application
 Can be extended with database integration, GUI, or APIs

# Files Included
eCommerce_Store.ipynb → Main Jupyter Notebook file
requirements.txt → List of required libraries (if provided)
README.md → Project documentation (this file)
data/ → Optional folder for product/customer/order data

# Future Enhancements
 Add a GUI (Tkinter / PyQt)
 Connect to a Database (SQLite, MySQL, MongoDB)
 Add user login & authentication
 Simulate payment gateway integration
 Add dashboards/visualizations for sales reports
